That's a great question. When configuring alerts for an Elasticsearch cluster using Auto Ops, it's crucial to focus on the ones that signal immediate or impending critical failures. The most important alerts can be broken down into a few key categories: cluster health, resource utilization, and data integrity.

### Cluster Health and Availability

These are the most critical alerts to set up, as they indicate that your cluster is in a bad state and may be experiencing data loss or downtime.

* **Cluster Status: `Red`**: This is the top priority. A red status means that one or more primary shards are unassigned, which results in data being unavailable or even lost. You should configure an alert that notifies you immediately if the cluster status changes to `red`.
* **Cluster Status: `Yellow`**: A yellow status means that a replica shard is unassigned. While this doesn't cause data loss, it compromises your cluster's high availability and resilience. If a node fails, you could lose data. An alert for a `yellow` status is a high-priority warning that needs to be addressed.

### Resource Utilization

These alerts help you prevent problems before they impact cluster health and performance. They are essential for proactive management.

* **High JVM Memory Pressure**: This is one of the most common causes of cluster instability. When the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory usage on a node gets too high, it triggers frequent garbage collection, which can freeze the node and cause it to be disconnected from the cluster. A good practice is to alert when JVM memory on any node exceeds 75-80%.
* **High CPU Usage**: Sustained high CPU usage on a data node can be a sign that the node is struggling to handle the current indexing or search load. It can lead to slow response times and eventual node failure.
* **Disk Watermarks**: Elasticsearch uses disk watermarks to prevent nodes from running out of disk space, which would make them unable to save new data. The most critical watermark is the **`flood_stage`**, which causes Elasticsearch to block all indexing. You should set up an alert that triggers well before the `high` watermark (e.g., at 80% disk usage) to give you time to add more storage or delete old data.

### Indexing and Performance

These alerts are important for ensuring your cluster is performing as expected and that users are getting a good experience.

* **Search Latency**: If your search queries are taking too long to execute, it directly impacts the user experience. You should configure an alert to notify you if the average search latency for your most critical searches exceeds a certain threshold.
* **Indexing Rate**: For applications that constantly ingest data, an unexpected drop in the indexing rate can be a sign that there is a problem with your data source or the cluster's ability to keep up.

To summarize, your first step should always be to set up alerts for a `red` or `yellow` cluster status and high disk usage. From there, you can add resource utilization and performance-based alerts to build a robust monitoring system.
